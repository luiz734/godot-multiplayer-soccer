# Multiplayer Soccer
This is a simple, cross-platform multiplayer soccer game created using Godot 4.

This project is not intended to be used as a learning resource. 
It's my first attempt at making a multiplayer game. 
My goal was to understand how multiplayer works in Godot. 
You will find better learning resources on the internet.

## How to Play?
- Add a nickname, network address, and click on Host or Join.
- You **don't** have to specify the port: it runs on port 55667 by default.
- The game doesn't support single-player mode.
- Make sure the host creates the lobby before attempting to connect.
- I've tested it on **Linux** and **Android**, but it should work on any platform supported by Godot.
